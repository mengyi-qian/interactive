      <em style="font-family: Times">What's in My Schoolbag? </em>
      Is a book I made out of 191 textbooks I used bet<mark>w</mark>een 2001 and 2013,
      <br>including <s>6-years primary sc<mark>h</mark>ool, 3-years middle school <mark>a</mark>nd 3-years high school</s>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <mark>T</mark>extbooks may be the most irksome book for Chinese students. Being the only book<mark>s</mark> that are
      <br>allowed to read in class, they’re <u>bor<mark>i</mark>ng and badly desig<mark>n</mark>ed, full of texts to recite and problems to
      <br>solve but nothing fun to interest us.</u> Then we started to put another book inside a larger textbook,
      <br>pretending that we’re still reading the textbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother wrapped all my textbooks using different papers with beautiful patterns printed on
      <br>them. Lots of my class<mark>m</mark>ates did this too. We all did this because the<mark>y</mark>’re too ugly to look at while
      <br>our parents thought this can protect our book<mark>s</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the book wasn’t protected, and we never thought about cherishing them, I believe. We used
      <br>to buy dozens of textbooks and even more exer<mark>c</mark>ise books each year. Part of them we never even
      <br>used while some ot<mark>h</mark>ers were teared apart, covered by drawings, pages missing <mark>o</mark>r broken…
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m glad that I kept these <mark>o</mark>ld textbooks, and it was a fun process to make this book, looking back
      <br>on what I went through at the innocent age and how my generation was educated. I was impressed
      <br>by those <u>beautiful drawings and the fine detai<mark>l</mark>s of the illustrations in science <mark>b</mark>ook</u>, but also
      <br>surprised by the amount of <u>ridiculous contents</u> in the textbook. Sometimes I start to recall the
      <br>memories <mark>a</mark>t that time when looking at a page. And I love it when people feel the same way while
      <br>looking at this book.
